## Task 9.0: Power at Sea - Wave Energy Powered Water Pump

### Overview
This task will leverage an existing stand-alone, float-spar point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) and integrate it with a hydraulic/pump PTO in order to pump cooler, nutrient rich near-bottom water up to offshore aquaculture kelp or fish farms.

### Status
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Progress | 75% Complete |
| Schedule Status | At Risk |
| Budget Status | On Track |
| Risk Level | Medium |

### Project Activities Completed
- Literature review completed utilizing various research databases
- Tank testing of existing WEC device completed at UNH Engineering Tank
- Field testing at Shoals Marine Lab completed
- DAQ development and calibration completed
- Draft field report submitted for internal review

### Current Challenges
- Repeated tank testing failures requiring redesign
- Weather delays impacting field deployment schedule
- Integration issues with new CFD model

### Plans for Next Quarter
- Complete system redesign report (Deliverable 9.5.2)
- Finalize WEC-Sim numerical model validation
- Begin procurement for Phase 2 field deployment

### Notes
Initial deployment showed promising results but identified structural improvements needed for long-term ocean deployment.

### Overview
Upgrade and operate the Memorial Bridge tidal turbine test site, including installation of new monitoring equipment and conducting performance validation tests.

### Status
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Progress | 60% Complete |
| Schedule Status | Delayed |
| Budget Status | Over Budget |
| Risk Level | High |

### Project Activities Completed
- Site assessment and baseline measurements completed
- New sonar and load pin sensors acquired
- NEPA consultation initiated with DOE

### Current Challenges
